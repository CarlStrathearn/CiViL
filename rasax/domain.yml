Bake 1 cup of pecan halves in the oven for about 5 minutes or until they are toasted. Remove them and let them cool down for about 10 minutes. Then, transfer the pecans into the bowl of a food processor. Add 1 cup of sugar into the food processor bowl and process the pecans and sugar together until the nuts are almost entirely broken down.
